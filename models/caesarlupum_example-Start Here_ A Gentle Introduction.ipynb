And not just in dollars, but in environmental impact.\n\nThankfully, significant investments are being made to improve building efficiencies to reduce costs and emissions. So, are the improvements working? That’s where you come in. Current methods of estimation are fragmented and do not scale well. Some assume a specific meter type or don’t work with different building types.\n\nDeveloping energy savings has two key elements: Forecasting future energy usage without improvements, and forecasting energy use after a specific set of improvements have been implemented, like the installation and purchase of investment-grade meters, whose prices continue to fall. One issue preventing more aggressive growth of the energy markets are the lack of cost-effective, accurate, and scalable procedures for forecasting energy use.\n\nIn this competition, you’ll develop accurate predictions of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, natural gas, hot water, and steam meters. The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe.\n\nWith better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.\n\n![image](https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/shell-scenario-sky/_jcr_content/pageCarouselImage.img.960.jpeg/1521983923121/future-of-energy-homepage-r.jpeg?imwidth=960)\n\n\n> About the Host\n\n   Founded in 1894, [ASHRAE](https://www.kaggle.com/orgs-under-maintenance) serves to advance the arts and sciences of heating, ventilation, air conditioning refrigeration and their allied fields. ASHRAE members represent building system design and industrial process professionals around the world. With over 54,000 members serving in 132 countries, ASHRAE supports research, standards writing, publishing and continuing education - shaping tomorrow’s built environment today.\n    \n# Data    \nAssessing the value of energy efficiency improvements can be challenging as there's no way to truly know how much energy a building would have used without the improvements. The best we can do is to build counterfactual models. Once a building is overhauled the new (lower) energy consumption is compared against modeled values for the original building to calculate the savings from the retrofit. More accurate models could support better market incentives and enable lower cost financing.\n\nThis competition challenges you to build these counterfactual models across four energy types based on historic usage rates and observed weather. The dataset includes three years of hourly meter readings from over one thousand buildings at several different sites around the world.\n\n### Files\n> #### train.csv\n- building_id - Foreign key for the building metadata.\n- meter - The meter id code. Read as {0: electricity, 1: chilledwater, 2: steam, hotwater: 3}. Not every building has all meter types.\n- timestamp - When the measurement was taken\n- meter_reading - The target variable. Energy consumption in kWh (or equivalent).
